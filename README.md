# NLP_Project_2021
In this project, Natural Language Processing (word embedding and then sentiment analysis) is performed on Hindi dataset and Bengali dataset. The whole project is divided into 3 separate tasks.

The repository includes the .ipynb files for the 3 tasks, naming Task1, Task2 and Task3.

The repository also includes some models for testing purposes (user can also create new model while running the full code, changing some parameters like learning rate or epoch).

Finally the repository includes a documentation about the project (with theoritical and practical descriptions).


## Task1 Average Loss vs Epoch Graph:
In task1, Hindi word embedding model is trained.
